Previous research have shown that different EF develops at different stages of adolescence, however, none of them shows the sensitivity or vulnerability of different EF under stress. This research, therefore, is looking at the vulnerability of selected executive functions under acute stress in adolescence. According to a meta-analysis, stress impaired working memory (WM) and cognitive flexibility, whereas it had nuanced effects on inhibition (Shields et al., 2016), therefore, this research mainly focused on the performance of WM and cognitive flexibility (shifting). The data here is collected from 46 participants using Aquapressure produced by MIT, a game-based assessment of executive functions.
